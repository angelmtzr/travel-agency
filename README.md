# travel-agency

Simple flights travel agency web application built using the **MERN** stack: **MongoDB**, **Express.js**, **React.js**, and **Node.js**. Behind the scenes the app communicates with an **API** in order to fetch the flights information. This is most certainly a project that demonstrates knowldege of full-stack web development.

### FRONTEND

Accompanying **React.js** in the frontend side of the application, **Tailwind CSS** is used to handle **CSS** more easily and design all of the application's screens.

### BACKEND

On the other side, in the backend, **Express.js** and **Node.js** are used to setup all of the server-side operations that will communicate with **MongoDB**.
